**There are some openings for graduate students (MSc, Ph.D.), research assistants, and post-docs  in my team. Please contact me if you are interested.**

Chao Wang is an Assistant Professor at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). Before joining SUSTech, Chao was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis. He worked with Prof. [Chen-Nee Chuah](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet/). He completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics from The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the direction of Prof. [Raymond Chan](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/hon-fu-raymond-chan(98f1cf10-a01a-4642-8470-c48b0e977687).html) and worked closely with Prof. [Robert Plemmons](https://faculty.sites.wfu.edu/plemmons/) at Wake Forest University. Previously, he worked with Prof. [Yifei Lou](https://sites.google.com/site/louyifei/)  at the University of Texas (UT) Dallas and Prof. [Xun Jia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/xun-jia) at UT Southwestern Medical Center.


His research interests include scientific computing, deep learning, tensor recovery, compressed sensing, interdisciplinary mathematical modeling, convex and nonconvex optimization, and hyperspectral and medical imaging.
