Chao Wang is an assistant professor at Southern University of Science and Technology [(SUSTech)](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/). Before joining SUSTech, Chao was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of California Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). He worked with Prof. [Chen-Nee Chuah](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet/) at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/). He completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) under the direction of Prof. [Raymond Chan](http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/rhfchan/) and worked closely with Prof. [Robert Plemmons](https://faculty.sites.wfu.edu/plemmons/) at [Wake Forest University](https://www.wfu.edu/). Previously, he worked with Prof. [Yifei Lou](https://sites.google.com/site/louyifei/) at the University of Texas (UT) Dallas and Prof. [Xun Jia](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/xun-jia) at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

His research interests include scientific computing, compressed sensing, interdisciplinary mathematical modeling, convex and nonconvex optimization, medical imaging, machine learning, and numerical linear algebra.
